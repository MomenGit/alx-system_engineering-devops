- What a server is
	- A **server** is a piece of computer hardware or software (computer program) that provides functionality for other programs or devices, called "clients".
- The role of the domain name
	- DNS is, in simple words, the technology that translates human-adapted, text-based domain names to machine-adapted, numerical-based IP
	- i.e. From: www.foobar.com -> to: 8.8.8.8
- The type of DNS record `www` in `www.foobar.com` is
	- A CNAME record type
- The role of the web server is
	- A web server handles the HTTP protocol, by receiving HTTP requests and send back HTTP responses
	- Delivers web pages through the HTTP protocol
- The role of the application server is
	- The application server serves the business logic
- The role of the database is
	- The database is an organized collection of data, its role is to store application data in an organized way
- What the server using to communicate with the computer of the user requesting the website is
	- The TCP/IP protocol suite
- The issues with this infrastructure are:
- Multiple SPOF due to no replicas of the followings
	- The Hardware server
	- The application server
	- The Nginx web server 
	- The MySQL Database server
- Downtime when maintenance needed 
	- If any maintenance needed for any of the servers (i.e the application server) the system would go down causing low availability
- Cannot scale if too much incoming traffic
	- As the server could run out of resources and slow down and there are no replicas or load balancer
